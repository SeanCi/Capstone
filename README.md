# Capstone

My capstone is a stock market price prediction model trained on stock market data over decades.

Capstone Model at Scale.ipynb: the notebook where the model itself is built

Capstone_Data.ipynb: the notebook where the first dataset I useed is cleaned before my mentor told me to use a larger dataset 
I use the cleaned data here later in the capstone to show how the capstone model can make future predictions.
This outputs a file called cleaned_data.csv.

Deep_Learning_Capstone.ipynb: an adaptation of tensorflow docs I was experimenting with.
This is unrelated to the capstone itself and was simply an earlier attempt at taking the project in a different direction.

Large_Data_Cleaning.ipynb: the notebook which cleans the dataset that the capstone model is actually trained on

model.pkl: the pickle model output from 'Capston Model at Scale.ipynb'

Heroku-flask folder: contains all the code for building the Flask app for the deployment of the app on Heroku.
